# Contributor Guidelines

Hey there! Thank you for your interest in contributing to my open-source project(s). Your contributions will help make my projects better and encourage other users to contribute as well!

Here you can view some basic guidelines that will help make the contribution process quick, easy, painless, and effective. It is important that you follow these guidelines in order to ensure that your contribution does not hinder the success of the project.

I ask that you kindly respect the time of me and the maintainers helping to manage my repositories, and in return, I will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issues and pull requests, and providing assistance throughout the contribution process.

## Code of Conduct

I take my open-source projects very seriously, and as such, I kindly ask that you read and adhere to the terms outlined in the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sanelkukic/.github/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to any of my open-source projects, you agree that you have read and are willing to uphold the Code of Conduct and these Contributor Guidelines.

## Getting Started

There are two primary methods of contributing to any open-source project of mine on GitHub:

- Issues (including bug reports, feature suggestions, and support inquiries)
- Pull Requests (code contributions)

If you have never contributed to open-source projects before, that's fine! I will provide you with assistance throughout the entire process to ensure that you learn how to make high-quality, valuable, and effective contributions!

### Issues

Issues should be used to report bugs, request features to be added, and to request support with any of my projects. There are three different forms that you can choose from based on which type of issue you wish to submit.

To submit an issue, go to the repository of mine that you wish to contribute to, and select the Issues tab.

**Prior to submitting an issue**, it is *highly* recommended that you use the search bar to see if someone else already submitted the same issue as you. Doing this helps me and other fellow repository maintainers keep things tidy and fast.

If you find an issue that addresses the problem or request you are having, please add your own information to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests are contributions of code to any of my projects. They are strictly scrutinized to ensure that they do not affect the performance of the program and to ensure that they follow the code standards I lay out for my projects.

My projects are written in any of the following languages: C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, and/or CSS.

I know that I, often times, get lazy with unit testing. However, sometimes I'm not lazy and I do write unit tests. If a project that you wish to contribute to does have unit tests, then I kindly ask that you also write unit tests for your code if it fixes something or changes the program's functionality.

Other than that, when submitting pull requests you should follow these key points:
- Only fix or add the functionality in question. Do not start adding a bunch of features all at once. While I appreciate your dedication and passion to the project, this helps to keep things neat, clean, and easy-to-audit.
- If a project has a test suite, and your code fixes or changes functionality, please write unit tests for your code as well.
- Include documentation regarding your code, such as inline code comments, Javadocs, JSDoc, etc.
- Fill out the [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/sanelkukic/.github/tree/main/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) as thoroughly as possible. This template is automatically loaded when you go to create your pull request.

If you wish to implement changes that would address the core functionality of a program, or changes that would be very significant ("breaking changes"), it is best to open an Issue as a "PR Proposal" to discuss your changes first prior to contributing your code. This can help ensure that there are no headaches later and can help save time creating and reviewing changes.

It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with [Git](https://git-scm.com) prior to contributing code. I follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr) for all of my projects. This workflow essentially boils down to the following steps:
- Create a "fork" of my repository by clicking the fork button on GitHub
- Clone your fork down to your local machine
- Create a branch locally with a descriptive name (for example, if you are addressing a bug report with the issue number 24, you could name the branch `bugfix-24`, if you have a PR proposal open then it is recommended that you name your branch starting with `proposal-` and the issue number of your PR proposal, such as `proposal-19` for instance)
- Commit your changes to the new branch
- Follow any other formatting and testing guidelines specific to that repo
- Push your changes to your fork
- Create a pull request in the original repository owned by me and follow these pull request guidelines.
